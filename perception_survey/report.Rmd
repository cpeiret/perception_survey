## The data

The data used in this project was obtained from the Flash Eurobarometer 419, and it can be accessed via this link: <https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA6641>.

The data includes the results of the Urban Audit Perception Survey. This survey includes responses from `r nrow(raw_data)` individuals across `r length(unique(raw_data$cities))` European cities.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
