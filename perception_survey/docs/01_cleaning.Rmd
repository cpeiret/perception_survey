```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

library(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()

```

## Prepare the data
The first step will be analysing the relationship between measured air quality and air quality perception.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
clean_data = raw_data %>%
  select(serialid, cities, q1_10) %>% # select only satisfaction with air quality
  rename(sat_air = q1_10) %>% # recode so we have a nice ordinal variable
  mutate(
    sat_air = case_when(
      sat_air == "Very satisfied" ~ 4,
      sat_air == "Rather satisfied" ~ 3,
      sat_air == "Rather unsatisfied" ~ 2,
      sat_air == "Not at all satisfied" ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    )
  ) %>%
  na.omit() # omit NAs

head(clean_data)

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
